===> Problem Statement:
Given a database table TRIANGLES with three columns (A, B, and C) representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, write a query to determine the type of triangle or whether the given lengths do not form a triangle. The result should be one of the following:

Equilateral: All three sides are of equal length.
Isosceles: Two sides are of equal length.
Scalene: All sides have different lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

===> Solution:

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END AS Triangle_Type
FROM TRIANGLES;

===> Explanation:
-> Not A Triangle:
A triangle is valid only if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If this condition is not satisfied (A + B <= C, A + C <= B, or B + C <= A), the result is Not A Triangle.

->Equilateral:
A triangle is equilateral if all three sides are equal (A = B AND B = C).

->Isosceles:
A triangle is isosceles if at least two sides are equal (A = B OR B = C OR A = C).

->Scalene:
A triangle is scalene if all three sides are of different lengths, meaning none of the equality conditions hold.

===>Test Cases:
-> Test Case 1:
Input:
A = 5, B = 5, C = 8

->Output:
Isosceles
===>Explanation: Two sides are equal (A = B = 5), so it is an Isosceles triangle.

===> Test Case 2:
Input:
A = 6, B = 6, C = 6

===> Output:
Equilateral
Explanation: All three sides are equal (A = B = C = 6), so it is an Equilateral triangle.
