===> Problem Statement:
Write a query to find the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in the CITY table. This will help identify the population disparity across cities.

Input Format:
The CITY table has the following structure:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
ID	INT	Unique identifier for each city.
Name	VARCHAR	Name of the city.
CountryCode	CHAR(3)	Country code where the city is located.
District	VARCHAR	District of the city.
Population	INT	Population of the city.

===> Solution:
We will compute the difference between the maximum population (MAX(Population)) and the minimum population (MIN(Population)) using the SQL query:

SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===> Explanation:

- MAX(Population):
 Returns the highest population value in the CITY table.

- MIN(Population):
 Returns the lowest population value in the CITY table.

- Difference Calculation:
 The subtraction of the minimum population from the maximum population gives the population disparity.

- Alias (AS PopulationDifference):
Renames the result column to PopulationDifference for clarity.

===>Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input (CITY Table):
ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	CityA	ABC	District1	120000
2	CityB	DEF	District2	250000
3	CityC	GHI	District3	80000

===>Query:

SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===>Output:
170000

===>Test Case 2:
Input (CITY Table):
ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	CityX	JKL	District4	500000
2	CityY	MNO	District5	100000
3	CityZ	PQR	District6	300000

===>Query:
SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===>Output:
400000
