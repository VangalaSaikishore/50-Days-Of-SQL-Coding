===> Title:
Retrieve Names of Cities in Africa

===>Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the names of all cities located in countries within the continent of Africa using the CITY and COUNTRY tables.

===>Solution:

SELECT CITY.Name 
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
WHERE COUNTRY.Continent = 'Africa';

===>Explanation:
- The JOIN statement connects the CITY table to the COUNTRY table through CountryCode and Code.
- The WHERE clause filters only the countries that belong to the 'Africa' continent.
- The query outputs the Name of all cities from these African countries.

===>Test Cases with Examples:

COUNTRY Table:

Code	Name	Continent
NGA	Nigeria	Africa
EGY	Egypt	Africa
FRA	France	Europe

===> Expected Output:
