===>Problem Statement:
Given two tables, CITY and COUNTRY, write an SQL query to calculate the total population of all cities located in the continent 'Asia'. The tables are related by CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code.

===>Solution:

SELECT SUM(CITY.Population) AS TotalPopulation
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
WHERE COUNTRY.Continent = 'Asia';

===>Explanation:

- The JOIN clause combines the CITY and COUNTRY tables based on the common key: CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code.
- The WHERE clause filters the data to include only rows where the Continent is 'Asia'.
- The SUM function adds up the Population of all the selected cities.
- The result is displayed under the alias TotalPopulation.
