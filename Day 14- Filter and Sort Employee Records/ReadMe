===>Problem Statement:
Write a query to print the names of employees (from the Employee table) whose monthly salary is greater than a given threshold and who have been working in the company for fewer months than a given limit. The results should be sorted in ascending order of their employee_id.

===>Solution:

SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > 5000 AND months < 4
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;

==>Explanation:
- Table Structure: The Employee table contains the following columns:
- employee_id: A unique identifier for the employee.
- name: The name of the employee.
- months: The total number of months the employee has worked in the company.
- salary: The employee monthly salary.

===>Filter Conditions:

- Employees with a salary greater than 5000 are selected (salary > 5000).
- Employees who have been with the company for fewer than 4 months are selected (months < 4).

===>Sorting:
- The results are sorted in ascending order by employee_id to ensure proper ordering.

===>Query Execution:
- The query retrieves the name column for all employees meeting the conditions, and it sorts them by their employee_id.

===>Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input Table (Employee):
employee_id | name      | months | salary  
1           | Angela    | 1      | 6000  
2           | Michael   | 2      | 5500  
3           | Todd      | 3      | 7000  
4           | Joe       | 4      | 8000  
5           | Sarah     | 5      | 5000  

==>Expected Output:
Angela  
Michael  
Todd  

===>Explanation:
Angela, Michael, and Todd satisfy the conditions (salary > 5000 and months < 4).
The results are sorted by employee_id in ascending order.

===>Test Case 2:
Input Table (Employee):
employee_id | name      | months | salary

2           | Rachel    | 2      | 7000  
3           | Sam       | 3      | 8000  
4           | John      | 4      | 5500  

==>Expected Output:
Rachel  
Sam  

===>Explanation:
Rachel and Sam satisfy the conditions (salary > 5000 and months < 4).
