===> Problem Statement:
Query Cities with Even ID Numbers from STATION Table
You are given a table named STATION with the following columns:

ID (NUMBER): The unique identifier for each station.
CITY (VARCHAR2(21)): The name of the city.
STATE (VARCHAR2(2)): The state abbreviation.
LAT_N (NUMBER): The northern latitude.
LONG_W (NUMBER): The western longitude.

Your task is to query a list of distinct city names (CITY) from the STATION table where the ID is an even number. The result should exclude duplicates and can be returned in any order.

===>Solution
To solve this problem, you can use the following SQL query:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 0;

===>Explanation:
1. SELECT DISTINCT CITY: This retrieves the unique names of cities from the CITY column. Using DISTINCT ensures that there are no duplicate city names in the result.
2. FROM STATION: Specifies the table from which to fetch the data.
3. WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 0: The MOD(ID, 2) function returns the remainder when the ID is divided by 2. This condition filters the rows to only include cities where the ID is even.

===>Test Cases
->Test Case 1
->Input:
ID: 1, CITY: 'New York', STATE: 'NY', LAT_N: 40.7128, LONG_W: -74.0060
ID: 2, CITY: 'Los Angeles', STATE: 'CA', LAT_N: 34.0522, LONG_W: -118.2437
ID: 3, CITY: 'Chicago', STATE: 'IL', LAT_N: 41.8781, LONG_W: -87.6298
ID: 4, CITY: 'Houston', STATE: 'TX', LAT_N: 29.7604, LONG_W: -95.3698
ID: 5, CITY: 'Phoenix', STATE: 'AZ', LAT_N: 33.4484, LONG_W: -112.0740

===>Expected Output:
Los Angeles
Houston
