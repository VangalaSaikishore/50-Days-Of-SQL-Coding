===> Problem Statement
You are given an OCCUPATIONS table that contains the names of individuals and their respective professions. The task is to:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names, immediately followed by the first letter of their profession in parentheses. For example, a doctor named "Alice" would appear as Alice(D).
Count the occurrences of each occupation, and output the results in the format:
There are a total of [count] [occupation]s.
Sort the output first by the count of each occupation in ascending order.
If two occupations have the same count, order them alphabetically.

===>Solution
===>Query 1: Generate Names with Occupation Initials

SELECT Name || '(' || SUBSTR(Occupation, 1, 1) || ')' 
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;

===>Query 2: Count and Output Each Occupation

SELECT 
    'There are a total of ' || COUNT(*) || ' ' || LOWER(Occupation) || 's.'
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC, Occupation ASC;

===>Explanation
===>Query 1 Explanation:

SUBSTR(Occupation, 1, 1) extracts the first character of the Occupation column (e.g., "D" for "Doctor").
|| is used for string concatenation.
The result combines the Name with the occupation initial in parentheses and sorts the output alphabetically by Name.

===>Query 2 Explanation:

COUNT(*) counts the number of rows for each occupation.
LOWER(Occupation) ensures the occupation name is lowercase in the output.
The output is formatted using concatenation and ordered by the count of occupations in ascending order. If two occupations have the same count, they are sorted alphabetically.

                                                                                
===>Test Cases
Test Case 1: Input

+----+--------+------------+
| ID | Name   | Occupation |
+----+--------+------------+
| 1  | Alice  | Doctor     |
| 2  | Bob    | Singer     |
| 3  | Carol  | Actor      |
| 4  | David  | Doctor     |
| 5  | Eve    | Professor  |
| 6  | Frank  | Singer     |

===>Expected Output for Query 1:

Alice(D)
Bob(S)
Carol(A)
David(D)
Eve(P)
Frank(S)

===>Expected Output for Query 2:

There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 1 actors.
There are a total of 1 professors.
