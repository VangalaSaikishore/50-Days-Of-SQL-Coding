===> Problem Statement:
Samantha calculated the average monthly salaries for employees but later realized her keyboard '0' key was broken. 
This caused all salaries entered to have zeros removed (e.g., "1500" became "15"). 
We need to find the absolute difference between the correct average salary and her miscalculated average, then round the result up to the next integer.

===>Solution:

SELECT CEIL(AVG(salary) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(CAST(salary AS CHAR), '0', '') AS UNSIGNED))) AS error 
FROM EMPLOYEES;

===>Explanation:
- Actual Average Salary: Compute using AVG(salary).

- Miscalculated Salary:
            - Convert each salary to a string.
            - Remove all '0' characters using REPLACE().
            - Convert the result back to a number and compute the average.

- Difference: Subtract the miscalculated average from the actual average.

- Rounding Up: Use CEIL() to round the difference to the next integer (handling cases like 2061.0 → 2061, 2061.1 → 2062).

===>Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Sample Input:

ID	Salary
1	1000
2	2000
3	15000

Miscalculated Salaries: 1, 2, 15

Actual Average: (1000 + 2000 + 15000) / 3 = 6000

Miscalculated Average: (1 + 2 + 15) / 3 = 6

Error: 6000 - 6 = 5994 → CEIL(5994) = 5994

Test Case 2:
Edge Case (Zero in Salary):

ID	Salary
1	0
Miscalculated Salary: 0 → 0 (since removing '0' leaves an empty string, which becomes 0).

Actual Average: 0 → 0

Error: 0 - 0 = 0 → CEIL(0) = 0

Test Case 3:
Mixed Salaries:

ID	Salary
1	5040
2	3020
Miscalculated Salaries: 54 (5040 → "5040" → "54"), 32 (3020 → "3020" → "32")

Actual Average: (5040 + 3020) / 2 = 4030

Miscalculated Average: (54 + 32) / 2 = 43

Error: 4030 - 43 = 3987 → CEIL(3987) = 3987
