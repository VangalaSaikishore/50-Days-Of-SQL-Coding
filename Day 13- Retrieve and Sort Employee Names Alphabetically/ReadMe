===>Problem Statement

Write a query to retrieve and print a list of employee names (name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order. The output should list all employee names sorted in ascending order, with no additional conditions applied.

The Employee table contains the following columns:
employee_id: A unique identifier for each employee (INTEGER).
name: The name of the employee (VARCHAR).
months: The number of months the employee has worked at the company (INTEGER).
salary: The monthly salary of the employee (INTEGER).

===>Solution
The SQL query to achieve this is:

SELECT name
FROM Employee
ORDER BY name ASC;

===>Explanation
- SELECT name: Retrieves the name column from the Employee table.
- ORDER BY name ASC: Sorts the names in ascending alphabetical order. The ASC keyword ensures the default sorting order is followed, starting with A and ending with Z.
