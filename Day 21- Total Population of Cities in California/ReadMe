===>Problem Statement:
Given a table CITY containing information about cities, query the total population of all cities where the District is California.

===>Table Structure:
The CITY table has the following columns:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
ID	INT	Unique identifier for each city.
Name	VARCHAR	Name of the city.
CountryCode	CHAR(3)	Country code where the city is located.
District	VARCHAR	District of the city.
Population	INT	Population of the city.

===>Input:
The table CITY will contain multiple rows with information about cities.

===>Requirements:
Write a SQL query to calculate the sum of the Population column for all rows where the District column is 'California'.

===>Solution:
Here is the SQL query to solve the problem:

SELECT SUM(Population) AS TotalPopulation
FROM CITY
WHERE District = 'California';

===>Explanation:
- SELECT SUM(Population): This computes the total population of all cities that match the condition in the WHERE clause.
- FROM CITY: Specifies that the data is to be retrieved from the CITY table.
- WHERE District = 'California': Filters the rows to include only those where the District column is California.
- AS TotalPopulation: Assigns a descriptive alias to the result for clarity.

===>Test Cases:
