===> Problem Statement
Write a query to calculate the average population of all cities in the CITY table. The result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

===>Solution
The SQL query to solve this problem is:

SELECT FLOOR(AVG(Population)) AS AveragePopulation
FROM CITY;

===>Explanation
- AVG(Population): Computes the average population of all cities in the CITY table.
- FLOOR: Rounds the result down to the nearest integer.
- AS AveragePopulation: Renames the resulting column for clarity.
- This query ensures that the average population is calculated and presented as an integer value.

===>Test Cases
Test Case 1: Valid Population Data
Input Data:

ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	City A	XYZ	District 1	100000
2	City B	XYZ	District 2	200000
3	City C	XYZ	District 3	300000

===>Query:

SELECT FLOOR(AVG(Population)) AS AveragePopulation
FROM CITY;

===>Expected Output:

AveragePopulation
200000

===>Test Case 2: Single City in Table
Input Data:

ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	City A	XYZ	District 1	150000

===>Query:

SELECT FLOOR(AVG(Population)) AS AveragePopulation
FROM CITY;

===>Expected Output:

AveragePopulation
150000
