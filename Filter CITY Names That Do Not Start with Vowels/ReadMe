===>Problem Statement:
Query the distinct names of all cities in the STATION table that do not start with vowels (i.e., 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Ensure no duplicates appear in the output. The query should handle case sensitivity and edge cases gracefully.

The STATION table is structured as follows:

ID: Unique identifier for the station (NUMBER).
CITY: Name of the city (VARCHAR2(21)).
STATE: State abbreviation (VARCHAR2(2)).
LAT_N: Northern latitude (NUMBER).
LONG_W: Western longitude (NUMBER).

===>Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

===>Explanation:
- SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)-Extracts the first character of the CITY column.
- UPPER():Converts the extracted character to uppercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
- NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'):Filters out cities whose names start with vowels.
- DISTINCT: Ensures that duplicate city names are excluded from the result.

===>Test Cases:
==>Test Case 1: Cities with Mixed Starting Letters
Input (CITY column values):
'Agra', 'Berlin', 'Oslo', 'Mumbai', 'Kyoto', 'Edinburgh'

==>Expected Output:
Berlin  
Mumbai  
Kyoto  

===>Test Case 2: Cities Starting with Vowels Only
==>Input (CITY column values):
'Agra', 'Oslo', 'Edinburgh', 'Innsbruck'

==>Expected Output:
(No rows)
