===>Problem Statement
Given two tables, Students and Grades, generate a report with the following columns: Name, Grade, and Marks.

===>Report Requirements:
Display only students with Grade ≥ 8 along with their names.
If a students Grade < 8, display "NULL"** as the Name** instead.

===>Sorting Order:
- Sort primarily by Grade in descending order.
- If multiple students have the same Grade ≥ 8, sort them alphabetically by name.
- If multiple students have the same Grade < 8, sort them in ascending order by marks.

===>Table Schema

Students Table
Column Name	Data Type	Description
ID	INTEGER	Unique student ID
Name	VARCHAR	Student name
Marks	INTEGER	Student marks

Grades Table
Column Name	Data Type	Description
Grade	INTEGER	Grade assigned
Min_Mark	INTEGER	Minimum marks for the grade
Max_Mark	INTEGER	Maximum marks for the grade

===>SQL Query

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN g.Grade < 8 THEN 'NULL' 
        ELSE s.Name 
    END AS Name, 
    g.Grade, 
    s.Marks
FROM Students s
JOIN Grades g 
ON s.Marks BETWEEN g.Min_Mark AND g.Max_Mark
ORDER BY g.Grade DESC, 
         (CASE WHEN g.Grade >= 8 THEN s.Name END) ASC, 
         (CASE WHEN g.Grade < 8 THEN s.Marks END) ASC;

===>Explanation
- Step 1: Join Students and Grades Tables
The JOIN is performed using the Marks column, where Marks falls between Min_Mark and Max_Mark.

- Step 2: Use CASE to Display Name or "NULL"
If the Grade ≥ 8, display the students name.
If the Grade < 8, display "NULL" as the name.

- Step 3: Apply Sorting Rules
First, sort by Grade in descending order.
For students with Grade ≥ 8, sort alphabetically by Name.
For students with Grade < 8, sort by Marks in ascending order.

===>Sample Test Cases
Test Case 1: Normal Scenario

- Input Data
Students Table
ID	Name	Marks
1	Maria	99
2	Jane	81
3	Julia	88
4	Scarlet	78
5	Paul	63
6	Tom	68

Grades Table
Grade	Min_Mark	Max_Mark
10	90	100
9	80	89
8	70	79
7	60	69

===>Expected Output
Name	Grade	Marks
Maria	10	99
Jane	9	81
Julia	9	88
Scarlet	8	78
NULL	7	63
NULL	7	68

===>Test Case 2: All Grades Below 8
Input Data
Students Table
ID	Name	Marks
1	Alex	50
2	John	45
3	Max	55

Grades Table
Grade	Min_Mark	Max_Mark
7	60	69
6	50	59
5	40	49

===>Expected Output
Name	Grade	Marks
NULL	6	50
NULL	5	45
