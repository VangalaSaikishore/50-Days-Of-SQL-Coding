===>Problem Statement
You are given a table named CITY that contains information about various cities. Your task is to write a query to calculate the average population of all cities in the CITY table where the District is California. The result should display a single column named AveragePopulation.

===>Solution:
The SQL query to solve this problem is:

SELECT AVG(Population) AS AveragePopulation
FROM CITY
WHERE District = 'California';

===>Explanation:
- AVG(Population): Calculates the average of the Population column values that meet the condition.
- FROM CITY: Specifies the table containing city data.
- WHERE District = 'California': Filters rows to include only those cities where the District is California.
- AS AveragePopulation: Renames the resulting column for clarity.
- The query will return the average population of cities in the district of California.
