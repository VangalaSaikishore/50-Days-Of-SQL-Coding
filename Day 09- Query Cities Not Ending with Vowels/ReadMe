===>Problem Statement:
Query the list of unique CITY names from the STATION table that do not end with a vowel (i.e., 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Ensure no duplicates in the result. Handle potential errors gracefully, such as null or empty values in the CITY column.

The STATION table has the following structure:

ID: Unique identifier for the station (NUMBER).
CITY: Name of the city (VARCHAR2(21)).
STATE: State abbreviation (VARCHAR2(2)).
LAT_N: Northern latitude (NUMBER).
LONG_W: Western longitude (NUMBER).

===>Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1)) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

===> Explanation:
SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1)
Extracts the last character of each city name using the length of the city name to determine the position.

UPPER()
Converts the extracted character to uppercase, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison.

NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
Filters out city names ending with vowels.

DISTINCT
Removes duplicate city names from the result set.

Error Handling
Handles null or empty CITY values implicitly since LENGTH(CITY) and SUBSTR will not process them.

===>Test Cases:
Test Case 1: Cities Not Ending with Vowels
Input (CITY column values):
'Berlin', 'Oslo', 'Kyoto', 'Lima'

===>Expected Output:

Berlin  
Kyoto  

===>Test Case 2: Null and Empty CITY Values
Input (CITY column values):
'Delhi', null, '', 'Paris'

===>Expected Output:

Delhi  
Paris
