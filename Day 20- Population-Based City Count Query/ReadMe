===> Problem Statement
You are given a table named CITY that contains details about various cities. Your task is to write a query to count the number of cities with a population greater than or equal to 100,000. The result should display a single column labeled CityCount.

===>Solution
The SQL query to solve the problem is as follows:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS CityCount
FROM CITY
WHERE Population >= 100000;

===>Explanation
- COUNT(*): This function counts the total number of rows that meet the specified condition.
- FROM CITY: Specifies the table containing the city data.
- WHERE Population >= 100000: Filters the rows to include only those cities where the Population is greater than or equal to 100,000.
- AS CityCount: Provides an alias to the result column for better readability.
- The query will return a single row with the count of cities that satisfy the condition.

===>Test Cases
Test Case 1: Cities with Population Greater Than or Equal to 100,000
Input Data:

ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	CityA	XYZ	DistrictA	150000
2	CityB	XYZ	DistrictB	90000
3	CityC	XYZ	DistrictC	200000

===>Query:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS CityCount
FROM CITY
WHERE Population >= 100000;

===>Expected Output:
CityCount
2

===>Test Case 2: All Cities Meet the Condition
Input Data:

ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	CityA	XYZ	DistrictA	120000
2	CityB	XYZ	DistrictB	130000

===>Query:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS CityCount
FROM CITY
WHERE Population >= 100000;

===>Expected Output:
CityCount
2
