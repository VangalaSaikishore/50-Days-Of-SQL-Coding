===> Problem Statement
You are provided with a table named CITY that contains information about various cities, including their population. Write a query to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum populations among all cities in the CITY table.
The result should be a single column named PopulationDifference.

===> Solution
The SQL query to solve this problem is:

SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===> Explanation
- MAX(Population): Finds the city with the highest population in the CITY table.
- MIN(Population): Finds the city with the lowest population in the CITY table.
- MAX(Population) - MIN(Population): Calculates the difference between the largest and smallest population values.
- AS PopulationDifference: Assigns a meaningful name to the resulting column.
 This query computes the range of population values across all cities.

===>Test Cases
Test Case 1: Multiple Cities with Varied Populations
Input Data:

ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	Tokyo	JPN	Tokyo-to	9000000
2	Osaka	JPN	Osaka-fu	2700000
3	Kyoto	JPN	Kyoto-fu	1470000
4	Hiroshima	JPN	Hiroshima	1190000

===>Query:

SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===>Expected Output:
PopulationDifference
7810000

===>Test Case 2: Single City in the Table
Input Data:
ID	Name	CountryCode	District	Population
1	Tokyo	JPN	Tokyo-to	9000000

===> Query:
SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population) AS PopulationDifference
FROM CITY;

===>Expected Output:
PopulationDifference
0
