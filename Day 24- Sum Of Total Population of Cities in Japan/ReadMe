===> Problem Statement
You are given a table named CITY that contains information about various cities, including their population and country codes. Write a query to calculate the total population of all cities in the CITY table where the COUNTRYCODE is 'JPN' (Japan).

The result should display a single column named TotalPopulation.

===> Solution
The SQL query to solve this problem is:

SELECT SUM(Population) AS TotalPopulation
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';

===>Explanation
- SUM(Population): Aggregates the population of all cities where the condition is satisfied.
- FROM CITY: Specifies the source table containing city data.
- WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN': Filters rows to include only cities in Japan, as identified by their COUNTRYCODE.
- AS TotalPopulation: Renames the resulting column to indicate it represents the total population.
- The query will return a single number representing the combined population of all Japanese cities in the CITY table.

===>Query:
